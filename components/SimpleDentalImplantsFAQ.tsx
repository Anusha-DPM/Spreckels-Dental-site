      question: "How long do dental implants last?",
      answer: "With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last a lifetime. They are designed to be a permanent solution for missing teeth."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the implant procedure painful?",
      answer: "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, so you won't feel pain during the surgery. Some mild discomfort may occur during the healing period, which can be managed with over-the-counter pain medication."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the entire process take?",
      answer: "The complete process typically takes 3-6 months, including the healing period. This allows time for the implants to properly fuse with your jawbone before placing the final restoration."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is a good candidate for dental implants?",
      answer: "Most adults with good overall health and sufficient jawbone density are good candidates. We'll evaluate your specific situation during the consultation to determine if implants are right for you."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I care for my dental implants?",
      answer: "Dental implants require the same care as natural teeth - regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups. No special maintenance is required."
    },
    {
      question: "Are dental implants covered by insurance?",
      answer: "Coverage varies by insurance plan. Many plans provide partial coverage for dental implants. We can help you understand your specific coverage and explore financing options."
