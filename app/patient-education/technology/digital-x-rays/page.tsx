                What are Digital X-Rays?
              </h2>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 font-sans">
                Digital X-rays use electronic sensors instead of traditional film to capture images of your teeth and jaw. This technology provides immediate, high-quality images that can be viewed on a computer screen, enhanced, and stored electronically. Digital X-rays offer significant advantages over traditional film X-rays in terms of safety, speed, and image quality.

                How Digital X-Rays Work
              </h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 font-sans">
                Digital X-rays use a small sensor that is placed in your mouth to capture the image. The sensor is connected to a computer, and the X-ray image appears instantly on the screen. The technology uses much less radiation than traditional film X-rays while providing clearer, more detailed images that can be easily manipulated and enhanced for better diagnosis.

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2 font-sans">
                <li>Reduced radiation exposure (up to 90% less than traditional X-rays)</li>
                <li>Immediate results - no waiting for film development</li>
                <li>Higher quality images with better detail</li>
                <li>Ability to enhance and zoom images for better diagnosis</li>
                <li>Easy storage and sharing of images</li>
                <li>No need for chemical processing</li>
                <li>Environmentally friendly - no film or chemicals</li>

                When Digital X-Rays are Used
              </h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 font-sans">
                Digital X-rays are used for the same diagnostic purposes as traditional X-rays, including detecting cavities, evaluating bone health, checking for impacted teeth, and monitoring dental development. They are particularly valuable for detecting problems in their earliest stages when treatment is most effective.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 font-heading">
                What to Expect During the Process
              </h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 font-sans">
                The digital X-ray process is similar to traditional X-rays but faster and more comfortable. A small sensor is placed in your mouth, and the X-ray is taken. The image appears immediately on a computer screen, allowing your dentist to review it right away. The sensor is smaller and more comfortable than traditional film holders.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 font-heading">
                Safety and Radiation Exposure
              </h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 font-sans">
                Digital X-rays use significantly less radiation than traditional film X-rays, making them much safer for patients. The reduced radiation exposure is especially beneficial for children and patients who need frequent X-rays. The technology also eliminates the need for chemical processing, making it safer for the environment as well.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 font-heading">
                Image Quality and Diagnosis
              </h3>
              
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 font-sans">
                Digital X-rays provide superior image quality compared to traditional film. The images can be enhanced, zoomed, and adjusted for better visibility of specific areas. This improved image quality helps dentists detect problems earlier and make more accurate diagnoses, leading to better treatment outcomes.
